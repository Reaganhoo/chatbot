#📄 Policy Chatbot using RAG (LangChain + Gemini + ChromaDB)

This project is a Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) chatbot that answers questions based on a company policy PDF instead of relying on an LLM’s internal knowledge.

It uses Google Gemini, LangChain, and ChromaDB to perform semantic search and generate accurate, grounded responses.
```bash
🎓 Built using Gemini’s free student tier, making it accessible for learners.
```
